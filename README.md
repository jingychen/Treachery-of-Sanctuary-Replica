# Treachery-of-Sanctuary-Replica
Exploring the field of mixed reality and interactive wall projections inspired by Chris Milk's work.

1. Uses Microsoft Kinect V2 to generate silhouette using depth image in Open frameworks.
2. Texture Frames generated in Open Frameworks are communicated to Unity3D using Spout plugin. 
3. Wings are attached to spine of skeleton generated by Kinect V2 SDK
4. Wing flap is implemented by rotating (with interpolation) transform.forward of the elbow joint of the rigged wing.
5. Skeleton and silhouette alignment is done by mapping CameraSpacePoints (3D) to ColorSpacePoints (2D) using the Kinect SDK.

All work done in development of this project excluding the spout plugin is personal and thus may not be used commercially without my permission.
